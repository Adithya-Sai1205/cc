Step-by-Step Instructions:
--------------------------
1. Setting Up the Cloud Environment:
   - Launch four EC2 instances for parallel training and one EC2 instance for the prediction application.
   - Use an SSH client to connect to your instances.

2. Model Training (Parallel on 4 EC2 Instances):
   - Clone the GitHub repository to your EC2 instances.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile and run the WineQualityModelTraining.java file to train the model in parallel.

3. Saving and Loading the Model:
   - The trained model will be saved automatically in an S3 bucket (specified in the Java code).
   - For loading the model, use the specified S3 path in the WineQualityPrediction.java file.

4. Prediction Application (On a Single EC2 Instance):
   - Clone the GitHub repository to your prediction EC2 instance.
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Compile and run the WineQualityPrediction.java file to perform predictions.
   - Optionally, build and run the Docker container (instructions below).



Note:
- Replace [Insert GitHub Repository Link] and [Insert Docker Hub Container Link] with the actual links.
- Ensure that your AWS credentials and permissions are correctly set up on each EC2 instance.
